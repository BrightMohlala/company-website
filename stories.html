			<h2>Client Success Stories</h2>
			<h4>1. Residential Air-conditioning Installation: The Smith Family</h4>
			<p>
				<em>Johannesburg, Gauteng</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Smith family contacted <strong>Witness & Sons</strong> after they started experiencing multiple breakdowns
				with their old air conditioning system. They were in the need of better and efficient way to maintain
				comfortable temperature in their house during the hot summer days.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Solution:<br>
				In the case of both our independence and assessment our team visited the Smiths’ home and suggested
				that a high-efficiency split system unit would be ideal for their home. We managed to install the system
				within a day to reduce the distress on the family as much as possible. The result? Lessening
				their monthly electricity bill drastically and a comfortably cool home all year round.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Client Feedback:
				<blockquote>
					<q>
						<em>
							Not a single objection can be raised to the service which was provided to us by the <strong>Witness & Sons</strong>!
							The new system installed is fantastic and the installation team was so courteous. Highly recommended!
						</em>
					</q>- Mrs. Smith

			<h4>2. Commercial Refrigeration Overhaul: Bright Supermarket</h4>
			<p>
				<em>Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There had been problems experienced by the Bright Star Supermarket since the freezers within the commercial refrigeration systems
				had been becoming less efficient in the cooling process resulting to unsalable stock and higher energy demands.
				They needed a trustworthy partner to assist in re-establishing a different authoritative form of the system and to minimize their losses.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Solution:<br>
				As for the refrigeration system in the team of colleagues, it was changed to modern, energy-saving equipment. We made sure that they were installed
				at night to enable them not to interrupt their operations. Also we introduced a proactive maintenance schedule to minimize occurrences of malfunctions
				and enhance operations of the systems.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Client Feedback:
				<blockquote>
					<q>
						<em>
							Without a doubt <strong>Witness & Sons</strong> excelled all expectations! Long term we have been able to cut a lot of cost due to energy efficiency
							offered by our new refrigeration units and our stocks are always well conditioned. They have been very prompt on after-sales service!
						</em>
					</q>– Mr. Dube, Store Manager

			<h4>3. Industrial HVAC Installation: Kwezi Manufacturing</h4>
			<p>
				<em>Phalaborwa, Limpopo</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Kwezi Manufacturing required a new HVAC system for the newly constructed factory as the factories requires tight temperature and humidity control
				for production quality purposes. They were searching for a team that has an adequate experience in working with the kind of system they have and
				at the same time capable of doing the large scale installation on the given system.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Solution:<br>
				The factory required a specialized HVAC system and Witness & Sons was tasked to supplying, install, and design the perfect system for the environment
				in the factory. The team was able to create proper airflow, and energy flow so as to enhance the general production conditions and lowered energy demands.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Client Feedback:
				<blockquote>
					<q>
						<em>
							All through, <strong>Witness & Sons</strong> has gone beyond my expectations. They acquitted themselves well in all aspects of the work and the installation was trouble free.
							That is our current operating situation, and the system is working perfectly.
						</em>
					</q>– Mr. Ndlovu, Operations Manager
